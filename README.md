Prerequisites
-------------
MATH 2300 or APPM 1360 (minimum grade C-)


Grading Policy
--------------
The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  

+ **Final exam:** 30 points    
+ **Mid-term exams:** 40 points (20 each)    
+ **Homework:** 25 points  
+ **Quizzes:** 5 points

At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to
the following table. However, the scale may be shifted, depending on overall 
student performance.  All curving (if any) will occur at the end of the semester.  

+ A: 94--100  
+ A-: 91--93  
+ B+: 87--90   
+ B: 84--86   
+ B-: 81--83   
+ C+: 77--80  
+ C: 74--76   
+ C-: 71--73   
+ D+: 67--70   
+ D: 64--66   
+ D-: 60--63   
+ F:  0--59    


Homework
--------
Online homework will be completed on WebAssign. See
[WebAssign-Instructions](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math207-Spring2015/blob/master/WebAssign-Instructions.html)
for registration instructions. (These instructions are also available on the
Blackboard site. The due date for online homework will be 
midnight on the Thursday and **no late homework will be accepted**. The lowest homework
score will be dropped at the end of the semester.

Quizzes and Exams
-----------------
There will be a number of quizzes, two midterm exams, and one final exam.

+ **Test 1** Chapters 1--3  
**DATE: Thursday, February 19**  
  
+ **Test 2** Chapters 4--5  
**DATE: Thursday, April 9**  

+ **FINAL EXAM** Chapters 1--7 (cumulative)  
**DATE/TIME: Friday, May 8, 7:30am--9:30am**

In accordance with university policy, the final exam is mandatory and must be
taken by all students at the scheduled time. Do not make travel plans before
knowing the date of the final exam.

Quizzes will occur approximately once per week, on Thursdays.  Generally each quiz
will focus on the material covered during the preceeding week. 
**There are no make-up quizzes or exams.** The lowest quiz score will be dropped.

Attendance
----------
Students are expected to attend all classes.
A grade penalty may be exacted if you have an excessive number of unexcused absences.
Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) seven
absences in total. 

However, since Math 207 is a large lecture, and because we will have near-weekly
quizzes, attendance should not be an issue for most students in this class.
Usually it only comes into play at the end of the semester if a student happens
to end up on the border between two letter grades.  In such cases, the professor
may look for things like an exemplary attendance record to justify moving the
student up into the next grade category. 

**Important:** If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention
this to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive
to your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture
is over.


Asking Questions
----------------

When you don't understand something, please ask a question!

1. **In Lecture.** The best time/place to ask a question is during lecture or recitation or office hours.

2. **On Piazza.** Another good place to ask a question is the online discussion
   forum.
   This term we will be using [Piazza][] for class discussion and all students
   should enroll in this forum by visiting the [Piazza signup page][].

   This system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from
   classmates, the TA, and the professor. Rather than emailing questions to the
   teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on Piazza forum.
   If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
   [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com). 

   Our class Piazza page is at: [Piazza][]

Email Policy
------------
You may email the instructor directly, though the response
time will generally be slower than if you use one of the preferred methods
described above.

If you email the instructor, you *must* use an informative subject field.
If you use <a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH 2130:
(fill in subject here)&amp;body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)">this link</a>  to email the professor, then some of the required information should pre-populate your message fields.  If you do not at least indicate which class you are in, your email may be ignored.


Use of Electronics During Lecture
---------------------------------
Silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods,
tablets, microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.
Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for example, is totally
unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to focus on what is
being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting to other
students. **Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated 
to math is strictly prohibited.**


Academic Honesty
----------------
Cheating is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy
will be referred to and dealt with in a manner consistent with university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the university.


Students With Disabilities
--------------------------
If you have a documented disability
or if you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act and requires accommodations, you should contact [Disability Services](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/)
for information on appropriate policies and procedures.

Your instructor will be happy to assist with accommodations, but will not
provide them retroactively, **so the appropriate requests and paperwork 
should be filed well before the first exam.**
